General Objectives 
--
This module serves as an introduction to the field of User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX), encompassing the study, planning, and design of interactions between users and computers, with the goal of enhancing the resulting user experience. It provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, theories, and principles related to the human aspect, technical aspects, and the interaction (interface) between human and machine. Moreover, it explores the process involved in designing user experiences, combining both theoretical knowledge and practical application. Throughout the module, students will delve into fundamental principles, design guidelines, prototyping techniques, evaluation methods, and the usage of software tools. By covering a wide range of topics, this module equips learners with a well-rounded understanding of UX design, empowering them to create effective and user-centric interfaces in modern computing environments.

Learning Outcomes
--
_On completion of the module, students will be able to:_
1. Understand the principles of user research and experience design
2. Infer and synthesize user needs and goals and create detailed and accurate user personas.
3. Apply the laws of UX to enhance the overall user experience.
4. Implement the laws of UX in practical scenarios to optimize UI design and enhance decision-making in UX.
5. Apply visual design principles to effectively and aesthetically design user interfaces that are visually appealing and enhance usability.
6. Employ microinteractions through animation feedback to create intuitive user experiences 
7. Evaluate and analyze UI designs by employing established evaluation techniques
8. Design and develop a static web application.

    Closed book, one hour duration in 7th  week
    
    Written Examination: Closed book, one hour duration in 7th week (15 marks)
    
    In the 7th week of the course, students will take a closed-book exam. The exam will have a      duration of one hour and will assess their understanding of the theoretical concepts            covered in the course. The quiz will be graded out of 100, and the marks will be allocated      based on the following criteria:
    
    1. Accuracy and completeness of answers
    2. Understanding of  the principles of user research and experience design
    3. Inference and the synthesis of  user needs and goals to create the  detailed and                accurate user personas.
    4. Application of  the laws of UX to enhance the overall user experience
  
2. Continuous Assessment ( Practical )
    --
      Throughout the course, students will be given four practical assignments and one final          project to assess their practical skills in understanding the principles of UIUX design.        The assignments will involve hands-on tasks related to web design.
      
      The practical assignments will be assessed based on the following criteria:
        1. Correct implementation of principles and laws of UX to enhance the overall user                 experience.
        2. Creation of engaging and interactive user experiences. 
        3. Evaluation and analyzation of UI designs by employing established evaluation                    techniques.
         4. Create semantically structured web pages with advanced styling

   2.1 Practical Assignment I (10 marks):
   -- 
      The students will be assessed based on their understanding of the following two units:
      Unit I: Introduction to User Research & Experience Design
      Unit II: Laws of UX

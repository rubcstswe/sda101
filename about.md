## About

Welcome to the SDA101 User Interface Design and Implementation module, offered as part of the BE Software Engineering program. This module provides an exciting introduction to the world of User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX) design, exploring the fascinating interactions between users and computers. Led by our Module Coordinator, Sonam Yangchen, and supported by Module Tutors Sonam Yangchen and Tashi Pelden, we are dedicated to equipping students with a comprehensive understanding of key concepts, principles, and techniques in UI/UX design. By merging theoretical knowledge with practical applications, learners will gain the skills to create effective, visually appealing, and user-centric interfaces in modern computing environments. Throughout the module, you'll delve into user research, experience design, visual design principles, responsive web interfaces, and front-end development for UI. We encourage you to actively engage in the learning process and unleash your creativity in crafting exceptional user experiences.

## Lecture

Our engaging lectures will take you on an insightful journey through the realm of User Interface Design and Implementation. Led by our experienced Module Coordinator, Sonam Yangchen, and co-taught by Module Tutors Sonam Yangchen and Tashi Pelden, you'll discover the principles of user research and experience design. We'll explore the Laws of UX, such as Fitts's Law, Hick's Law, and Jakob's Law, to understand their application in UI design and how they impact decision-making in UX. Visual design principles, color theory, and typography will be covered in-depth to enhance your design aesthetics and usability. We'll dive into responsive web interfaces, responsive layouts, and fluid grids, enabling you to create adaptive designs for various screen sizes. Moreover, you'll gain hands-on experience in front-end development for UI using HTML5, CSS3, and other tools. Our lectures aim to provide a solid foundation and practical insights, preparing you to excel in the field of UI/UX design.

## Resources
We've curated a collection of valuable resources to support your learning journey in the SDA101 User Interface Design and Implementation module. From recommended textbooks to online tutorials and articles, these resources offer in-depth knowledge and practical examples to enhance your understanding of UI/UX design. One of the essential readings is "Laws of UX: Using Psychology to Design Better Products & Services" by Jon Yablonski, which delves into the psychological principles behind effective design. Another valuable resource is "Refactoring UI" by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger, which provides practical insights into improving UI design using TailwindCSS. 

## Assignments

Throughout the module, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your practical skills in UI/UX design through a series of engaging assignments. These assignments are designed to evaluate your understanding of various concepts and principles while allowing you to apply them in real-world scenarios. The first assignment will focus on Units I and II, assessing your grasp of user research, experience design, and the Laws of UX. Subsequent assignments, II, III, and IV, will cover Units III, IV, and V, respectively, focusing on visual design principles, responsive web interfaces, and user experience evaluation. Lastly, the Final Project Assessment will test your knowledge of the entire syllabus, specifically Unit VI, which deals with front-end development for UI. Emphasizing creativity and problem-solving, these assignments will enable you to develop tangible skills and create visually engaging and user-friendly web applications. We encourage you to embrace these assignments as opportunities to refine your expertise and make meaningful contributions to the field of UI/UX design.
